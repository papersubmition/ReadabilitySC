# Replication Package for the paper entitled " An Empirical Investigation on the Trade-off between Smart Contract Readability and Gas Consumption"
Description of the content:
 ## RQ1: What are the main differences between traditional software and smart contracts in terms of code readability?
 `
The first research question aims at investigating the specific readability aspects for which smart contracts and traditional 
software differ. Making smart contract readable is a challenge, as best practices to obtain high readability could be often 
in contrast with strategies to reduce gas consumption. Since the development of traditional software is more marginally 
affected by the resource consumption problem, we compare the values obtained on both smart contracts and 
traditional software of specific code metrics.
 `
 ## RQ2: How do readability metrics correlate with the gas consumed for smart contract deployment?
   `
The second research question aims at investigating the smart contract readability aspects that most correlate with gas consumption.
In this research question, we attempt to start filling this gap by investigating the relationships existing 
(i) between the specific smart contract readability metrics and gas consumption and (ii) between each pair of readability metrics,
with the purpose of identifying the readability features that deserve attention during smart contract development.
